# TechRUs

## Project Proposal

TechRUs is an enterprise e-commerce platform which is built with the purpose of selling technology products to customers such as TVs, PS5 Video Games, External storage drives and much more. Moreover, the application is developed with a focus on the MVC, Micro-services and client/server architecture. Generally, most applications are developed using a monolithic architectural style, however as the size of the codebase grows in size over time, then these types of applications become very hard to manage by developers. Making them without a doubt very difficult to understand. Another problem with monolithic style applications is inevitably scalability.
