# TechRUs - https://techrus.dev

## Project Proposal

TechRUs is an enterprise e-commerce platform which is built with the purpose of selling electronic products to customers such as TVs, PS5 Video Games, External storage drives, tablets and so much more. TechRUs is a platform that is developed with a focus on the MVC, Microservices and client/server architecture. Generally, most applications are developed using the monolithic architectural style. However as the size of the codebase grows in size over time, then these types of applications become very hard to manage by developers working as part of a team. Making them without a doubt very difficult to understand. Another problem with monolithic style applications is inevitably scalability. 

Web applications which use the monolithic architecture are an increasingly popular approach for developing smaller projects with fewer features to develop. Monolithic applications are very simple to develop in the short-term whilst there’s not much code to be written for certain features in the beginning. However, in in the long term, using the monolithic approach causes significant development problems, one of them being scalability. This is due to certain factors such as lack of cohesion, scalability, robustness, and availability within the codebase which makes it difficult for developers to maintain a larger codebase. Moreover, enterprise style systems such as e-commerce stores which is a type of enterprise system which is going to be developed, tested, deployed, and evaluated are hard to maintain with this kind of architecture with regards to code modularity and lack of coupling between components. To overcome the issues that monolithic applications come with, we can instead convert the large codebase into smaller and standalone modules which fit into their own respective microservice. Each microservice has its own single source of truth making the application more modular, scalable, and robust as the code grows. Furthermore, this report is split up into several sections which describes and closely analyses the certain tasks which are going to be implemented with regards to the development of the e-commerce store.

The component mining section is going to outline various component descriptions with regards to the requirements with interface descriptions for each component. These include certain semantics such as the pre and post condition assertions which must hold true when the component carries out its task. The interfaces are also going to describe its provides and requires interface definitions which describes what the component does and what services are offered. Also, the monolithic to microservices section describes and evaluates the approaches taken to switch from the typical monolithic codebase into microservices. Furthermore, the microservices approach design is going to show some coherent diagrams that represents which services the e-commerce store is going to be using to fulfil the requirements. And, how they communicate with each other using coupling. After this section, the test-driven development approach is going to discuss and analyse the benefits of writing coherent test cases before certain features are implemented. The test plans are also going to be created for every single standalone microservice to prevent unforeseen errors from arising during development.

## Component Mining Approach

The e-commerce platform is going to be developed using multiple reusable components that makes the application more modular and maintainable. The first component which is going to be described in detail is the login component which is linked to the standalone authentication microservice. It is important that users create their account using some unique credentials in the form of username, e-mail address and their password before placing orders for one or more products. Users can login only with their e-mail and password to prevent unauthorized from malicious users. Below is a description of the login component and its interfaces. The login component is important for this system because it is a must have requirement for this project whereby staff users must authenticate before adding their shipping details, place an order for a product and pay for the product.

Component Name: Login Module

Component Description: The purpose of the login module is to allow staff users to authenticate to the system securely using sensitive credentials such as their e-mail address and password. Every time a single user attempts to login into the system, the component is going to check to see if the correct e-mail and password is provided by the user against the data stored inside the authentication database. Moreover, this component includes a server-side validation check that determines if the input data is feasible and in the correct format before logging the user in. However, this information is hidden from the end-user. Otherwise, if an incorrect e-mail address or password is provided, the authentication service returns a 400 bad request status code. Also, the module is going to query the authentication database to ensure that the e-mail address provided by the user in the body of the request currently exists in the schema. Otherwise, an error message is going to be returned to the user saying that the e-mail address provided does not exist should this assertion render true. This is another piece of information that’s hidden from the user. The final check that this module is going to undertake is an asynchronous password comparison before ultimately logging in the user. Once the user inputs their plaintext password into the password input field and clicks the login button, the current password is asynchronously compared against the plaintext password by making a call to the authentication schema which compares the entered plaintext password against the user’s hashed one. If they both match, the login module generates a unique JSON Web Token (JWT) that is randomly generated and assigned to that user to identify the user.

Login Module Interface Description: The login module has a couple of services which defines the various functions this module has to offer. Firstly, the login module validates the user’s e-mail address and password. Also, selecting the current user’s e-mail address from the authentication schema by querying the authentication database. It checks to see if the current user exists and compares login passwords before fully authenticating the user into the platform. Finally, the requires interface for this component is that the login module must generate a unique JWT token for the user if the login operation was successful and attaches it to the user’s cookie. The other requires interface is that the login module provides a service that sends the logged in user a two-factor verification code to the user’s e-mail inbox to verify their account for enhanced security. Figure 1.0 below is a diagram that represents the above interface descriptions.

## Products - User Interface

The figure below shows the available products that are available to leave reviews and create orders for after adding one or more products to basket. This page is developed using two reusable components, one being the search bar that allows users to search for a product and the products that can be viewed in the middle of the page.
