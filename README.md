# TechRUs - https://techrus.dev

## Project Proposal

TechRUs is an enterprise e-commerce platform which is built with the purpose of selling electronic products to customers such as TVs, PS5 Video Games, External storage drives, tablets and so much more. TechRUs is a platform that is developed with a focus on the MVC, Microservices and client/server architecture. Generally, most applications are developed using the monolithic architectural style. However as the size of the codebase grows in size over time, then these types of applications become very hard to manage by developers working as part of a team. Making them without a doubt very difficult to understand. Another problem with monolithic style applications is inevitably scalability. 

Web applications which use the monolithic architecture are an increasingly popular approach for developing smaller projects with fewer features to develop. Monolithic applications are very simple to develop in the short-term whilst thereâ€™s not much code to be written for certain features in the beginning. However, in in the long term, using the monolithic approach causes significant development problems, one of them being scalability. This is due to certain factors such as lack of cohesion, scalability, robustness, and availability within the codebase which makes it difficult for developers to maintain a larger codebase. Moreover, enterprise style systems such as e-commerce stores which is a type of enterprise system which is going to be developed, tested, deployed, and evaluated are hard to maintain with this kind of architecture with regards to code modularity and lack of coupling between components. To overcome the issues that monolithic applications come with, we can instead convert the large codebase into smaller and standalone modules which fit into their own respective microservice. Each microservice has its own single source of truth making the application more modular, scalable, and robust as the code grows. Furthermore, this report is split up into several sections which describes and closely analyses the certain tasks which are going to be implemented with regards to the development of the e-commerce store.

The component mining section is going to outline various component descriptions with regards to the requirements with interface descriptions for each component. These include certain semantics such as the pre and post condition assertions which must hold true when the component carries out its task. The interfaces are also going to describe its provides and requires interface definitions which describes what the component does and what services are offered. Also, the monolithic to microservices section describes and evaluates the approaches taken to switch from the typical monolithic codebase into microservices. Furthermore, the microservices approach design is going to show some coherent diagrams that represents which services the e-commerce store is going to be using to fulfil the requirements. And, how they communicate with each other using coupling. After this section, the test-driven development approach is going to discuss and analyse the benefits of writing coherent test cases before certain features are implemented. The test plans are also going to be created for every single standalone microservice to prevent unforeseen errors from arising during development.

## Products - User Interface

The figure below shows the available products that are available to leave reviews and create orders for after adding one or more products to basket. This page is developed using two reusable components, one being the search bar that allows users to search for a product and the products that can be viewed in the middle of the page.
